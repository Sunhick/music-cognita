The existing music recommendation approaches are based on a user's preference on music. However, sometimes, it might better meet users' requirement to recommend music pieces according to emotions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for emotion-based music recommendation. The core of the recommendation framework is the construction of the music emotion model by affinity discovery from film music, which plays an important role in conveying emotions in film. We investigate the music feature extraction and propose the Music Affinity Graph and Music Affinity Graph-Plus algorithms for the construction of music emotion model.

Unlike approaches that rely on music content and have been researched for almost two decades, music-context-based (or contextual) approaches to music retrieval are a quite recent field of research within music information retrieval (MIR). Contextual data refers to all music-relevant information that is not included in the audio signal itself. In this article, we focus on contextual aspects of music primarily accessible through web technology. We discuss different sources of context-based data for individual music pieces and for music artists. We summarize various approaches for constructing similarity measures based on the collaborative or cultural knowledge incorporated into these data sources. In particular, we identify and review three main types of context-based similarity approaches: text-retrieval-based approaches (relying on web-texts, tags, or lyrics), co-occurrence-based approaches (relying on playlists, page counts, microblogs, or peer-to-peer-networks), and approaches based on user ratings or listening habits. This article elaborates the characteristics of the presented context-based measures and discusses their strengths as well as their weaknesses.}},

    abstract = {{With the development of digital music technologies, it is an interesting and useful issue to recommend the 'favored music' from large amounts of digital music. Some Web-based music stores can recommend popular music which has been rated by many people. However, three problems that need to be resolved in the current methods are: (a) how to recommend the 'favored music' which has not been rated by anyone, (b) how to avoid repeatedly recommending the 'disfavored music' for users, and (c) how to recommend more interesting music for users besides the ones users have been used to listen. To achieve these goals, we proposed a novel method called  personalized hybrid music recommendation , which combines the content-based, collaboration-based and emotion-based methods by computing the weights of the methods according to users' interests. Furthermore, to evaluate the recommendation accuracy, we constructed a system that can recommend the music to users after mining users' logs on music listening records. By the feedback of the user's options, the proposed methods accommodate the variations of the users' musical interests and then promptly recommend the favored and more interesting music via consecutive recommendations. Experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy achieved by our method is as good as 90\%. Hence, it is helpful for recommending the 'favored music' to users, provided that each music object is annotated with the related music emotions. The framework in this paper could serve as a useful basis for studies on music recommendation.}},

    abstract = {{Many tasks in music information retrieval, such as recommendation, and playlist generation for online radio, fall naturally into the query-by-example setting, wherein a user queries the system by providing a song, and the system responds with a list of relevant or similar song recommendations. Such applications ultimately depend on the notion of similarity between items to produce high-quality results. Current state-of-the-art systems employ collaborative filter methods to represent musical items, effectively comparing items in terms of their constituent users. While collaborative filter techniques perform well when historical data is available for each item, their reliance on historical data impedes performance on novel or unpopular items. To combat this problem, practitioners rely on content-based similarity, which naturally extends to novel items, but is typically outperformed by collaborative filter methods. In this paper, we propose a method for optimizing content-based similarity by learning from a sample of collaborative filter data. The optimized content-based similarity metric can then be applied to answer queries on novel and unpopular items, while still maintaining high recommendation accuracy. The proposed system yields accurate and efficient representations of audio content, and experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy over competing content-based recommendation techniques.}},

    abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid music recommender system that ranks musical pieces while efficiently maintaining collaborative and content-based data, i.e., rating scores given by users and acoustic features of audio signals. This hybrid approach overcomes the conventional tradeoff between recommendation accuracy and variety of recommended artists. Collaborative filtering, which is used on e-commerce sites, cannot recommend nonbrated pieces and provides a narrow variety of artists. Content-based filtering does not have satisfactory accuracy because it is based on the heuristics that the user's favorite pieces will have similar musical content despite there being exceptions. To attain a higher recommendation accuracy along with a wider variety of artists, we use a probabilistic generative model that unifies the collaborative and content-based data in a principled way. This model can explain the generative mechanism of the observed data in the probability theory. The probability distribution over users, pieces, and features is decomposed into three conditionally independent ones by introducing latent variables. This decomposition enables us to efficiently and incrementally adapt the model for increasing numbers of users and rating scores. We evaluated our system by using audio signals of commercial CDs and their corresponding rating scores obtained from an e-commerce site. The results revealed that our system accurately recommended pieces including nonrated ones from a wide variety of artists and maintained a high degree of accuracy even when new users and rating scores were added.}},

    abstract = {{Context-based music recommendation is one of rapidly emerging applications in the advent of ubiquitous era and requires multidisciplinary efforts including low level feature extraction and music classification, human emotion description and prediction, ontology-based representation and recommendation, and the establishment of connections among them. In this paper, we contributed in three distinctive ways to take into account the idea of context awareness in the music recommendation field. Firstly, we propose a novel emotion state transition model (ESTM) to model human emotional states and their transitions by music. ESTM acts like a bridge between user situation information along with his/her emotion and low-level music features. With ESTM, we can recommend the most appropriate music to the user for transiting to the desired emotional state. Secondly, we present context-based music recommendation (COMUS) ontology for modeling user's musical preferences and context, and for supporting reasoning about the user's desired emotion and preferences. The COMUS is music-dedicated ontology in OWL constructed by incorporating domain-specific classes for music recommendation into the Music Ontology, which includes situation, mood, and musical features. Thirdly, for mapping low-level features to ESTM, we collected various high-dimensional music feature data and applied nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for their dimension reduction. We also used support vector machine (SVM) as emotional state transition classifier. We constructed a prototype music recommendation system based on these features and carried out various experiments to measure its performance. We report some of the experimental results.}},

    abstract = {{Mobile devices such as smart phones are becoming popular, and realtime access to multimedia data in different environments is getting easier. With properly equipped communication services, users can easily obtain the widely distributed videos, music, and documents they want. Because of its usability and capacity requirements, music is more popular than other types of multimedia data. Documents and videos are difficult to view on mobile phones' small screens, and videos' large data size results in high overhead for retrieval. But advanced compression techniques for music reduce the required storage space significantly and make the circulation of music data easier. This means that users can capture their favorite music directly from the Web without going to music stores. Accordingly, helping users find music they like in a large archive has become an attractive but challenging issue over the past few years.}},

    abstract = {{In the scope of the Challenge on Context-aware Movie Recommendation (CAMRa2010), context can mean temporal context (Task 1), mood (Task 2), or social context (Task 3). We suggest to use Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization (PITF), a method used for personalized tag recommendation, to model the temporal (week) context in Task 1 of the challenge. We also present an extended version of PITF that handles the week context in a smoother way. In the experiments, we compare PITF against different item recommendation baselines that do not take context into account, and a non-personalized context-aware baseline.}},

@article{citeulike:10833666,
    abstract = {{With rapid growth in the online music market, music recommendation has become an active research area. In most current approaches, content-based recommendation methods play an important role. Estimation of similarity between music content is the key to these approaches. A distance formula is used to calculate the music distance measure, and music recommendations are provided based on this measure. However, people have their own unique tastes in music. This paper proposes a method to calculate a personalized distance measure between different pieces of music based on user preferences. These methods utilize a randomized algorithm, a genetic algorithm, and genetic programming. The first two methods are based on Euclidean distance calculation, where the weight of each music feature in the distance calculation approximates user perception. The third method is not limited to Euclidean distance calculation. It generates a more complex distance function to estimate a user's music preferences. Experiments were conducted to compare the distance functions calculated by the three methods, and to compare and evaluate their performance in music recommendation.}},
